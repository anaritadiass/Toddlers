You get all of that in the Odyssey G9, which has a native 240Hz display at 5,120-by-1,440-pixel resolution (that's a 32:9 aspect ratio) in a curve. Most curved monitors have a radius (R) of 1800 to 3800...the lower R number of 1000 means it will surround you all the more.",

That's because Corsair's One a200 is liquid-cooled, so the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X inside is kept cold enough to deliver some stellar gaming performance. The dimensions of the sculpted-metal tower itself are ultracompact, one that goes back to 2017, measuring 15 by 6.9 by 7.9 inches—that's one-third the size of a typical mid-tower. The front sports ports galore with two zones of RGB color. If the gamer on your list lacks space but wants the ultimate gaming tower anyway, this is the one to get.",

But Vaonis has kicked us into smart telescope territory. The company's original scope, called the Stellina, puts a telescope that is part digital camera (with a Sony image sensor) on top of a stable tripod, all in a unit weighing under 25 pounds and measuring 19 by 15 by 4.7 inches. Connect it to a smartphone or tablet and use it to control the view and record or share 6.4-megapixel images of the planets. Multiple users, up to 10, can connect to the Stellina at once.",
